This Python script uses AWS SDK for Python (Boto3) to list EC2 instances, S3 buckets, and Elastic Load Balancers (ELBs) in your AWS account. It provides a simple way to retrieve and display key information about these AWS resources.
Requirements are as below - 
Python 3.x - Install Python in your environment/OS
AWS CLI to be installed - you can use the aws configure command to set up your credentials OR
If running on AWS (e.g., EC2, Lambda), you can attach an IAM role to your Instance/Lambda with the necessary permissions
AWS credentials configured (either via environment variables, ~/.aws/credentials, or IAM roles if running on AWS)
Boto3 library to be installed - pip install boto3
I used VSCODE to execute the code, If you are willing to use the same, then please create a Virtual environment and select appropriate Python Interpreter before you execute the code.
If you get stuck please contact me on my email address.
